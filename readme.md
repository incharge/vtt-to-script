## Installation

### Install Node.js
vtt-to-script requires Node.js to run. Node.js always runs inside a bash shell, regardless of whether the system is running Microsoft Windows, Linux, or MacOs.

To check whether Node.js is installed already on your system, run the following commands. Each command should output a version number.
```
node -v
npm -v
```

For installation instructions, see [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to run.

### Install Node.js on Microsoft Windows using win-code-node
win-code-node helps you get up and running quickly with Node.js on Microsoft Windows.

Start a command prompt and run the collowing commands:
```
mkdir my-node
cd my-node
curl -OJ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incharge/win-code-node/main/bootstrap.bat
.\bootstrap.bat --nocode
```

If the following error is displayed, then try disabling any anti-virus software that is blocking internet access e.g. `AVG WebShield`
```
curl: (35) schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK (0x80092012) - The revocation function was unable to check revocation for the certificate.
```

Subsequently, to start a bash shell, from Windows Explorer or a command prompt run `win-code-node\bash.bat`
